ARM11 Emulator
==============

Written in C for Imperial Colleges first year group project, this is an
emulator for the ARM11 cpu. It should also eventually include an
Assembler, somewhere down the road from now.

Testing is done by use of [FFI](https://github.com/ffi/ffi) and
[RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec), which allow wrapping of native
C functions for modular and functional testing.
